## Reporting bugs

If you found a bug in SharpSK and want to report it here then please make sure you are following the guidelines below.

**Bug report Guidelines:**

1. **Include enough info** &mdash; Things like console error logs (if any) or Server MC/SharpSK/Plugin(if from plugin hooks) versions.

2. **Verify that it's a new bug** &mdash; Make sure that the bug you are reporting has not been already reported/fixed before

3. **Be as detailed as possible** &mdash; Please tell as much as you can about the problem. 
Things like: "**It just doesn't work**" without providing anything won't help me to solve your issue.

## Suggesting new features:

if you'd like to suggest a new feature that you want to see in SharpSK then make sure you are following the guidelines below:

1. **Make sure it has not been included already** &mdash; You want to make sure that the feature you are suggesting is a new one.

2. **(Optional) Make sure to tell why you want it included** &mdash; This is not necessarily required. But giving a reason will most likely result in your suggestion getting put on higher priority if it's a must-have kind of thing.
